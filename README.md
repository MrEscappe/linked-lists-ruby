# Linked Lists
Part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

------------

### Assignment

#### You will need two classes:

1. LinkedList class, which will represent the full list.
2. Node class, containing a #value method and a link to the #next_node, set both as nil by default.

Build the following methods in your linked list class:

- append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
- prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
- size returns the total number of nodes in the list
- head returns the first node in the list
- tail returns the last node in the list
- at(index) returns the node at the given index
- pop removes the last element from the list
- contains?(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.
- to_s represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil

Extra Credit
- insert_at(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
- remove_at(index) that removes the node at the given index.

This project was quite challenging, new conceps and ways to tangle the code, but when I figure out how the Node.new worked evething makes sense.

The bonus challange also was challenging and i took some time to figure out.
